MapStich - merge multiple 2D maps
---------------------------------

 This is a ROS component and a command line tool to align a map to a previously
saved 2D map. The previously saved map is assumed to have been created by the
map_saver ROS component. The implementation is based on opencvs
estimateRigidTransform function, ORB feature extraction and matching the
distance of pairwise feature candidates.

 The ROS component can be run with "rosrun mapstitch ros_mapstitch" and supports
three parameters:
 * world_map, the filename of the previously saved map
 * max_distance, the treshold distance for filtering pairwise distances. Too
   high does not filter any features and too low filter too much. This is the
   pixel distance between matches in both maps, so should be set depending on
   the resolution of your maps.
 * debug, set to true will save the current_stitch.pgm and current_map.pgm, i.e.
   the stitchted maps and the current map as seen on /map.

 The command line tool can be run with bin/mapstitch and can be used to align
two previosuly saved .pgm maps on each other. The Usage is

bin/mapstitch  [-o <string>] [-v] [-d <max-distance>] [--] [--version]
                  [-h] <file1 and file2> ...


Where:

   -o <string>,  --outfile <string>
     output filename

   -v,  --verbose
     verbose output

   -d <max-distance>,  --maximum-distance <max-distance>
     maximum distance on matched points pairs for inclusion

   --,  --ignore_rest
     Ignores the rest of the labeled arguments following this flag.

   --version
     Displays version information and exits.

   -h,  --help
     Displays usage information and exits.

   <file1 and file2>  (accepted multiple times)
     input file names (first one is pivot element)


   Aligns multiple scan maps and combines into a single image. All images
   given on the command line will be aligned to the first supplied image
   and their respective rotation/translation and transformation matrix will
   be returned.



TODO
----
 * check that world file and /map have the same resolution
